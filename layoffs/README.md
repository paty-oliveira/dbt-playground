# Analysis of Layoff in Tech industry

## Goal
The goal of this project is to start using Python models for data modeling. For that, I chose a trendy
topic in the Tech industry - layoffs.

## Context
Tech firms around the globe are fighting the economic slowdown. The slow consumer spending, higher
interest rates by central banks and strong dollars overseas are hinting toward a possible recession and
tech firms have started laying employees off. This economic slowdown has made Meta recently
firing 13% of its workforce, which amounts to more than 11,000 employees. This dataset was made with
the hope to enable Kaggle community to look into analyzing recent tech turmoil and discover useful findings.

Tracking the tech layoffs reported on the following platforms:
- Bloomberg
- San Francisco Business Times
- TechCrunch
- The New York Times

The data availability is from when COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic i.e. 11 March 2020 to present
(11 November 2022).

## Data Source
The source of the layoff dataset is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022). Startup layoffs as reported on Layoffs.fyi from COVID (11 March 2020) to today.
